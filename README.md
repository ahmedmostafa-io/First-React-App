# 🚀 Start Framework Website

This project is a modern and responsive landing page built with React and powered by Vite for fast performance.
The UI/UX is inspired by the popular Start Bootstrap template, and the app was rebuilt from scratch using clean, scalable front-end practices.
It includes smooth page navigation using React Router, responsive design via Tailwind CSS, and a contact form with advanced validation using Formik and Yup.
